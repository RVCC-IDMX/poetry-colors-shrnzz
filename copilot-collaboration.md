# Copilot Collaboration Log

## Quick Summary

- Which mode did you use most? [Ask/Agent/Edit]
- Most helpful Copilot moment: Asking about concepts I do not understand.

## Key Interactions (3-5 entries)

### Setting up the project

**Mode:** Ask & Agent
**Why this mode:** I was able to understand what parts of my project were missing and how to resolve that.
**Helpful:** Created a .prettierrc file because the config file isn't automatically created when you install Prettier.

### Creating HTML structure

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** Ready to build after planning
**Helpful:** Generated semantic HTML matching my poem

### Fixing CSS colors

**Mode:** Edit
**Why this mode:** Needed to change existing styles
**Helpful:** Updated all color values to improve contrast

## What I Learned

- **Ask vs Agent:** Use Ask to understand, Agent to build
- **Best discovery:** [Something Copilot taught you]
- **Next time:** [One thing you'd do differently]
